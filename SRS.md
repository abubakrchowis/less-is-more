## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define the requirements for "Less is More," an iOS mobile application that helps users reduce their social media usage by implementing a gamified 40-day detox system. The application is designed to guide users through gradually increasing time intervals away from social media while offering motivational messages and progress tracking.

### 1.2 Scope

"Less is More" provides users with a clean, distraction-free experience and motivates them through a level-based system that rewards consistent abstinence from social media. The app uses local notifications, minimalist design, and data persistence via UserDefaults. No internet connection or backend server is required.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

- **SDLC**: Software Development Life Cycle
- **OOP**: Object-Oriented Programming

### 1.4 References

- Apple Developer Documentation: [https://developer.apple.com/documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation)

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

The app is a standalone iOS application developed using Swift and UIKit. It runs locally without needing an internet connection or user account. The target devices are iPhones running iOS 14 or higher.

### 2.2 Product Functions

- Present motivational content and detox tips at launch.
- Track user progress across 40 levels (1 hour to 40 hours).
- Schedule local notifications upon level completion.
- Visually display progress via timeline or progress bar.
- Save and restore progress using UserDefaults.

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

- **Primary User**: Individuals aged 12â€“50 who wish to reduce their time spent on social media.
- Users are expected to have basic familiarity with mobile apps but no technical knowledge.

### 2.4 Operating Environment

- Platform: iOS 15+
- Development Tools: Xcode, Swift, UIKit
- No third-party dependencies required.

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints

- Use only native iOS frameworks.
- Notifications must not rely on push services.
- Data must be stored locally and persist between sessions.

### 2.6 User Documentation

- README in GitHub repository
- In-app walkthrough and tips at launch

### 2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies

- The user will allow notification permissions.
- The device's local time is used to track progress.
- No network or external services are required.
